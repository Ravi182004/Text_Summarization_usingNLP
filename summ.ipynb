      " He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. His family originated from the then village of Kutiana in what was then Junagadh State. During his tenure, Karamchand married four times. Karamchand's family then rejoined him in Rajkot. They moved to their family home Kaba Gandhi No Delo in 1881.\n",
      " One of his favourite pastimes was twisting dogs' ears.\" Gandhi writes: \"It haunted me and I must have acted Harishchandra to myself times without number.\" The family's religious background was eclectic. she would take the hardest vows and keep them without flinching. To keep two or three consecutive fasts was nothing to her. There, he studied the rudiments of arithmetic, history, the Gujarati language and geography. At the age of 11, Gandhi joined the High School in Rajkot, Alfred High School. In late 1885, Gandhi's father, Karamchand, died. The two deaths anguished Gandhi. However, Gandhi dropped out and returned to his family in Porbandar.\n",
      " Gandhi had dropped out of the cheapest college he could afford in Bombay. Gandhi's uncle Tulsidas also tried to dissuade his nephew, but Gandhi wanted to go. Putlibai gave Gandhi her permission and blessing.\n",
      " His childhood shyness and self-withdrawal had continued through his teens. An achievement while on the committee was the establishment of a Bayswater chapter. In his 1927 An Autobiography, Vol. His distant cousin in Johannesburg needed a lawyer, and they preferred someone with Kathiawari heritage. Gandhi inquired about his pay for the work. They offered a total salary of £105 (~$4,143 in 2023 money) plus travel expenses. However, Gandhi refused to press charges against any member of the mob.\n",
      " They were trained and medically certified to serve on the front lines. They were auxiliaries at the Battle of Colenso to a White volunteer ambulance corps. His ideas of protests, persuasion skills, and public relations had emerged. Gandhi took these back to India in 1915.\n",
      " He suffered persecution from the beginning in South Africa. People would even spit on him as an expression of racial hate.\n",
      " The medical unit commanded by Gandhi operated for less than two months before being disbanded. Gandhi remarked that the Africans \"alone are the original inhabitants of the land. … The whites, on the other hand, have occupied the land forcibly and appropriated it for themselves. There, Gandhi nurtured his policy of peaceful resistance.\n",
      " \"So far I have not a single recruit to my credit apart,\" Gandhi wrote. He added: \"They object because they fear to die.\"\n",
      " Unhappy with this, the peasantry appealed to Gandhi at his ashram in Ahmedabad. He announced his satyagraha (civil disobedience) intentions. People rioted in retaliation. He emphasised the use of non-violence to the British and towards each other, even if the other side used violence. He reorganised the Congress. He began his sentence on 18 March 1922. The political base behind Gandhi had broken into factions. The British did not respond favourably to Gandhi's proposal. This day was commemorated by almost every other Indian organisation. It has reduced us politically to serfdom.\" Thousands of Indians joined him in Dandi. \n",
      " Not one of the marchers even raised an arm to fend off blows. They went down like ninepins. From where I stood I heard the sickening whack of the clubs on unprotected skulls... Those struck down fell sprawling, unconscious or writhing with fractured skulls or broken shoulders. This went on for hours until some 300 or more protesters had been beaten, many seriously injured and two killed. At no time did they offer any resistance. However, Congress estimates put the figure at 90,000. Among them was one of Gandhi's lieutenants, Jawaharlal Nehru.\n",
      " The government, represented by Lord Irwin, decided to negotiate with Gandhi. The conference was a disappointment to Gandhi and the nationalists. Churchill's bitterness against Gandhi grew in the 1930s. It gained Churchill sympathetic support, but it also increased support for Gandhi among Europeans. The developments heightened Churchill's anxiety that the \"British themselves would give up out of pacifism and misplaced conscience. He was enthusiastically received by East Enders. It came to be known as the Communal Award. In 1934, Gandhi resigned from Congress party membership. Gandhi declared that Sitaramayya's defeat was his defeat. While in jail, he agreed to an interview with Stuart Gelder, a British journalist. These discussions continued through 1947.\n",
      " However, the All-India Muslim League demanded \"Divide and Quit India.\" The British government did not order its army to move in to contain the violence. Wavell condemned Gandhi's character and motives as well as his ideas. The partition was controversial and violently disputed. According to some accounts, Gandhi died instantly. Our beloved leader, Bapu as we called him, the father of the nation, is no more. The prosecution called 149 witnesses, the defence none. The court found all of the defendants except one guilty as charged. Eight men were convicted for the murder conspiracy, and others were convicted for violation of the Explosive Substances Act. Savarkar was acquitted and set free. Gandhi's death was mourned nationwide. His ashes were poured into urns which were sent across India for memorial services. On 30 January 2008, the contents of another urn were immersed at Girgaum Chowpatty. A black marble platform, it bears the epigraph \"Hē Rāma\" (Devanagari: हे ! राम or, Hey Raam). These are said to be Gandhi's last words after he was shot.\n",
      " He stated that \"Unless you impose on yourselves the five vows you may not embark on the experiment at all.\" Gandhi summarised his beliefs first when he said, \"God is Truth.\" Gandhi would later change this statement to \"Truth is God.\" Thus, satya (truth) in Gandhi's philosophy is \"God\". It arms the individual with moral power rather than physical power. Gandhi wrote: \"There must be no impatience, no barbarity, no insolence, no undue pressure. If we want to cultivate a true spirit of democracy, we cannot afford to be intolerant. Intolerance betrays want of faith in one's cause.\" This end usually implies a moral upliftment or progress of an individual or society. Although Gandhi considered non-violence to be \"infinitely superior to violence\", he preferred violence to cowardice. \"\n",
      "Gandhi was a prolific writer. His signature style was simple, precise, clear and as devoid of artificialities. Later, Navajivan was also published in Hindi. This last essay can be considered his programme on economics. The writings comprise about 50,000 pages published in about 100 volumes. The Indian government later withdrew the revised edition.\n",
      " He is also hailed as the greatest figure of modern India.[f] As of 2008, over 150 countries have released stamps on Gandhi. King sometimes referred to Gandhi as \"the little brown saint.\" Others include Steve Biko, Václav Havel, and Aung San Suu Kyi.\n",
      " Generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this walked the earth in flesh and blood. Obama added, \"He's somebody I find a lot of inspiration in. He inspired Dr. King with his message of nonviolence. He ended up doing so much and changed the world just by the power of his ethics. It began with his engagement with Romain Rolland and Martin Buber. The University of Nagpur awarded him an LL.D. in 1937. Gandhi could do without the Nobel Peace prize, whether Nobel committee can do without Gandhi is the question.\" He is also conferred the title \"Bapu\" (Gujarati: endearment for father, papa).\n",
