# Text_Summarization_usingNLP

This project implements text summarization using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It processes text from user input, .txt files, PDFs, or Wikipedia URLs and generates a concise summary by ranking sentences based on their importance.

The approach involves:

-Tokenization: Breaking text into sentences and words.
-Stopword Removal: Eliminating common words that do not add significant meaning.
-Lemmatization: Converting words to their base forms.
-TF-IDF Calculation: Identifying the most relevant words and sentences.
-Sentence Scoring: Ranking sentences based on their importance.

Summary Generation: Extracting key sentences to create a meaningful summary.

This method ensures that the summary retains the most essential information while reducing the overall word count. It is useful for applications such as news summarization, academic research, and content optimization.
